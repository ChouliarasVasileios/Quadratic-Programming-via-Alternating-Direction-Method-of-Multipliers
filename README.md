# Quadratic-Programming-via-Alternating-Direction-Method-of-Multipliers
As part of the "Robotics Systems II" course under the supervision of Assistant Professor Kostantinos Chatzilygeroudis, I was assigned to implement Algorithm 1 from the paper ["OSQP: An Operator Splitting Solver for Quadratic Programs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08013). The goal was to apply this algorithm to design a controller for a dynamic system using Quadratic Programming (QP) techniques. The [assignment](https://github.com/ChouliarasVasileios/Quadratic-Programming-via-Alternating-Direction-Method-of-Multipliers/blob/main/ECEUoP_RS_2_HW_1.pdf) involved formulating the system's control problem as a QP, and then using Alternating Direction Method of Mulipliers method to compute optimal control inputs in real time. This allowed for efficient and reliable control of the system's dynamic behavior while satisfying its constraints.
