# Quadratic-Programming-via-Alternating-Direction-Method-of-Multipliers

This repository contains the implementaion of **Alorithm 1** form the paper ["OSQP: An Operator Splitting Solver for Quadratic Programs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08013) as a controller for a dynamic system using Quadratic Programming (QP) technigues. The project was developed as part of **Robotics System II course**, supervised by **Assistant Professor Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis.**

# Project Overview
The aim of this assignment was to:
- Model the dynamic system

- Implement an equality constrained **ADMM** algorithm **(Algorithm 1)**

- Demostrate how Quadratic Programming can be used as controller.

The Quadratic Programming (QP) technigues allowing for efficient and reliable control of the system's dynamics behavior while satisfying it's constrains.

# Report
A detailed technical report (["Homework1_Robotics_Systema_II.pdf"](https://github.com/ChouliarasVasileios/Quadratic-Programming-via-Alternating-Direction-Method-of-Multipliers/blob/main/Homework1_Robotics_Systems_II.pdf)) is provided in Greek documenting:

- The mathematical modeling of system
- Quadratic Programming via Alternative Directions Method of Multiplier (ADMM)
- Simulation results
